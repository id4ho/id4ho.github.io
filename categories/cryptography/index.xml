      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working through the cryptopals challenge set in Rust as a way to both learn about cryptography and learn Rust at the same time. One of the first significant challenges is writing code to break a repeating key xor cipher where you don&amp;rsquo;t know the length of the key. Without the tip on Hamming distance in the problem description, one (read: &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;) might attempt to solve the problem with a heinously inefficient algorithm to try every reasonable keysize.</description>
