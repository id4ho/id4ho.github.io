      <description>I ran into a couple hiccups trying to talk to the bee-box VM and figured I&amp;rsquo;d blog about how I worked through it/found a solution in case others have similar problems.
First off, bee-box is a custom Linux VM pre-installed with bWAPP. The (bWAPP)[http://www.itsecgames.com/] is an extremely buggy web application, with many different security problems that are discoverable/exploitable for practice.
In general, since you are intending to &amp;ldquo;attack&amp;rdquo; the bWAPP, it&amp;rsquo;s ideal that it&amp;rsquo;s on a machine other than your host machine.</description>
