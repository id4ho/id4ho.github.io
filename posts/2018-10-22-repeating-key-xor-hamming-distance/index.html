<p>I&rsquo;ve been working through the cryptopals challenge set in Rust as a way to both
learn about cryptography and learn Rust at the same time. One of the first
significant challenges is writing code to break a repeating key xor cipher where
you don&rsquo;t know the length of the key. Without the tip on Hamming distance in the
problem description, one (read: &lsquo;I&rsquo;) might attempt to solve the problem with a
heinously inefficient algorithm to try every reasonable keysize. There is, as
usual, a much simpler (and more interesting!) way.</p>

<h4 id="known-keysize-xor">Known keysize xor</h4>

<p>If you know the key length it is straightforward to programmatically crack a
repeating key xor problem. You brute force the key space and evaluate the
decrypted text to determine how similar it is to english (assuming you know the
plaintext to be english). This involves evaluating the frequencies of the
characters.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etaoin_shrdlu">etaoin shrdlu</a>.
Whichever is closest to the expected english letter frequencies is likely the
actual plaintext. But what if you don&rsquo;t know the keysize?</p>

<h4 id="hamming-distance">Hamming distance</h4>

<p>There is a way to determine the likely key length which involves calculating the
hamming distances for various block sizes and finding the block size that yeilds
the smallest hamming distance.</p>

<p>First, what is Hamming distance? This is simply the edit distance between two
bitstreams of equal length. I.e. how many bits do I need to flip in the first
bitstream to make it equal the second bitstream. You can calculate this by
xoring the two and counting the 1&rsquo;s in the result (since 0,0 and 1,1, pairs will
both be 0 in the xor result). This is a measure of how closely related the two
strings are.</p>

<p>With this measurement function you can then iterate through possible key length
sizes say.. 2 to 40<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and find the size with the smallest normalized<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
Hamming distance.</p>

<p>These instructions are enough to solve the problem but don&rsquo;t really explain
<em>why</em> this technique works. I&rsquo;ll try to do so below using some examples.</p>

<h4 id="why-search-for-a-small-hamming-distance">Why search for a small Hamming distance?</h4>

<p>First let&rsquo;s take the hamming distance of two blocks of plaintext (I&rsquo;m using
block here to denote that the strings are the same length):</p>

<pre><code>string1: &quot;this is a fantastic desk chair&quot;
string2: &quot;here is a short bit of english&quot;
hamming distance: 60
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, now let&rsquo;s xor these two strings with a random xor key and take the distance
of those two blocks:</p>

<pre><code>xor key: &quot;MLYHziJ4X748S7mV2Uen2IZ1TYoGkx&quot;
string1 xor'd with the key =&gt;
&quot;9$0;Z\u{0}9\u{14}9\u{17}RY=C\u{c}%F&lt;\u{6}NV,)Zt:\u{7}&amp;\u{2}\n&quot;
string2 xor'd with the key =&gt;
&quot;%)+-Z\u{0}9\u{14}9\u{17}GP&lt;E\u{19}vP&lt;\u{11}N]/zT:&gt;\u{3}.\u{18}\u{10}&quot;
distance of two xor'd blocks: 60
</code></pre>

<p>Could be a coincidence.. let&rsquo;s try with a different random key:</p>

<pre><code>xor key: &quot;Dx4TJaHyBnVvxK2JXoA3Bb0RdWDo0Y&quot;
string1 xor'd with the key =&gt; &quot;0\u{10}]\'j\u{8};Y#N0\u{17}\u{16}?S9,\u{6}\&quot;\u{13}&amp;\u{7}C9D4,\u{e}Y+&quot;
string2 xor'd with the key =&gt; &quot;,\u{1d}F1j\u{8};Y#N%\u{1e}\u{17}9Fj:\u{6}5\u{13}-\u{4}\u{10}7\n0(\u{6}C1&quot;
distance of two xor'd blocks: 60
</code></pre>

<p>The reason this is consistent is that since you&rsquo;re xoring two strings that have
been xor&rsquo;d with the same key. One property of xor is that xoring the same thing
twice yields a string of zeros which is the identity string with regards to
xoring. Furthermore, xor is commutative (order doesn&rsquo;t matter). So the keys
effectively cancel each other out and you wind up with the xor of the two
plaintext strings.</p>

<p>The upshot of this is that if we guess the right length for the key we are
actually looking at the edit distance between two plaintext blocks(!!).</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s see what happens when we compute the edit distances using the
incorrect keylength. The hypothesis here is that the edit distance will be
larger.</p>

<pre><code>plaintext: &quot;welcome to the zoo&quot;
xor_key (length 9): &quot;·hÀ\&quot;®¹ùÒ)&quot;
xor'd together =&gt; &quot;À\r¬AÁÔ\u{9c}ò]ØH´JË\u{99}\u{83}½F&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>We&rsquo;ve xor&rsquo;d the plaintext with a repeating key of length 9. If we assume a
keylength of 6:</p>

<pre><code>the first xor'd block looks like: &quot;À\r¬AÁÔ&quot;
the second xor'd block looks like: &quot;\u{9c}ò]ØH´&quot;
the hamming distance: 26
the normalized hamming distance for block length 6 is: 4.3333335
</code></pre>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s try with a blocksize of 9 (the correct length)</p>

<pre><code>the first xor'd block looks like: &quot;À\r¬AÁÔ\u{9c}ò]&quot;
the second xor'd block looks like: &quot;ØH´JË\u{99}\u{83}½F&quot;
the hamming distance: 30
the normalized hamming distance for block length 9 is: 3.3333333
</code></pre>

<p>Since the ciphertext changes every time, the number for the size 6 block jumps
around a bit each time the code that generates the above is run. The 3.333,
however, is consistent (since the keys are canceled out and we are actually
looking at the xor of the two plaintext blocks).</p>

<p>Note that since the keys are random, there is a chance that the edit distance of
the incorrect sized block is randomly small for a given key (more likely if that
key is only ascii charcters). Therefore to effectively utlized this technique
it&rsquo;s best to look at several blocks and not just the first two. When I solved
this problem I averaged the normalized distances of every pair of blocks in the
first 4 (1&amp;2,2&amp;3,3&amp;4,1&amp;3,2&amp;4,1&amp;4).</p>

<p>An important thing to note about why this technique works is that the edit
distance between a string of english and another string of english will
generally (hence the averaging of multiple blocks) be smaller than the edit
distance between two strings of random bytes which is essentailly what you are
calculating when you pick the wrong block size.</p>
