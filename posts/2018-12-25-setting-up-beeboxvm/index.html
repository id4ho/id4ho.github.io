  <main>
    <p>I ran into a couple hiccups trying to talk to the bee-box VM and figured I&rsquo;d
blog about how I worked through it/found a solution in case others have similar
problems.</p>

<p>First off, bee-box is a custom Linux VM pre-installed with bWAPP. The
(bWAPP)[<a href="http://www.itsecgames.com/">http://www.itsecgames.com/</a>] is an extremely buggy web application, with
many different security problems that are discoverable/exploitable for practice.</p>

<p>In general, since you are intending to &ldquo;attack&rdquo; the bWAPP, it&rsquo;s ideal that it&rsquo;s
on a machine other than your host machine. In my case I wanted to set it up and
run it in Virtualbox and they have a preconfigured vm for this exact purpose.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my host machine could not hit the guest&rsquo;s (VM&rsquo;s) IP and I had no
access to the bWAPP I was running in the VM.</p>

<p>The default networking set up is NAT, which by default does not allow the host
machine to access the guest without port forwarding. Some research led me to try
bridged networking, which in many circumstances would probably work. I was,
however, trying to set this up at a coffeeshop and the network seemed to be using
MAC-based registration to use the wifi. This got a bit weird but from what I
could tell the DHCP server wouldn&rsquo;t accept the connection from the guest
machine.</p>

<pre><code></code></pre>

<pre><code>~~~~~    TODO: Research how this captive portal/bridged issue works. Does it
work at all (not considering host-&gt; guest?) ~~~~~~~~~~
</code></pre>

<pre><code></code></pre>

<p>I still never managed to hit the site using the IP address of the guest machine,
but what I did manage to do was forward a port on my host machine to the server
in the guest on the appropriate port so that I could access the site at
localhost:8080 (8080 being the port that I mapped, but you could map another if
this is in use).</p>
