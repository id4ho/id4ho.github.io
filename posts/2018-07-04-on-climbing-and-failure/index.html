<h1 id="on-climbing-and-failure">On Climbing and Failure</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been ruminating on failure recently afer realizing I&rsquo;m too cautious when
climbing indoors<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and it may be stunting progress in a pretty non-trivial
way.</p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>

<p>What kicked off this particular iteration of self-reflection was running into a
friend at the bouldering gym with whom I lead-climb<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> regularly. He was
excited to show me his bouldering project which was a v9.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> Our skill levels
are similar so I was surprised by the grade. Indoors, I typically flash<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> v6
and v7&rsquo;s tend to go<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> within a couple tries, but I&rsquo;ve only ever done a couple
v8&rsquo;s and I&rsquo;d never even tried a v9. He talked me into trying his project. To my
unmitigated surprise, I fell only at the last move. He showed me another v9 that
he was working on. Again, I did way better than I expected.</p>

<p>The next time I went to the gym I got the first v9 and made progress on the
second, getting to within spitting distance.</p>

<h4 id="failure-avoidance">Failure Avoidance</h4>

<p>Why had I never tried a v9 before? Part of it is certainly that I assumed they
were too hard, but the more embarrassing part is that I was simple scared of
failing. Why do we get scared of failing? Maybe it&rsquo;s partly that failing will
confirm the suspicion that you aren&rsquo;t good enough. Maybe it&rsquo;s fear of failing in
front of your peers. The tech startup trope is to &ldquo;fail fast&rdquo; or celebrate
failure, but it&rsquo;s certainly easier said than done.</p>

<p>Playing it safe and only climbing things when I was confident of success
has probably robbed me of progress for a long time.</p>

<h4 id="discovering-and-surpassing-limits">Discovering and Surpassing Limits</h4>

<p>Struggling promotes growth, easy success tends to just maintain the status quo.</p>

<p>This is immediately apparent for physical endeavours. You break down muscle so
that it comes back stronger. It&rsquo;s less obvious for mental endeavours, but imagine
a programmer who only ever implemented the fibonnaci sequence or a merge-sort
algorithm; small toys that they know they can write successfully. Or imagine a
chess player who only ever challenges their immediate family. The lack of
serious challenge will prevent any kind of progress.</p>

<p>Challenges without assured success reveal true limits and provide opportunities
to surpass those limits. Maybe you succeed and have a new personal best or
newfound confidence in yourself; at worst, these types of challenges provide a
barometer for growth or a future goal.</p>

<h4 id="going-forward">Going forward</h4>

<p>This experience has made me wonder whether self-doubt or handicapping has
preventing me from growing in other disciplines. Going forward, when learning or
trying to improve at some discipline, I&rsquo;ll intentionally find projects or
challenges that seem just out of reach and work on them anyways. I expect this
will help paint a more accurate picture of my capabilities as well as help me
get more comfortable with failing.</p>

Don&rsquo;t get hung up on the actual number here, it&rsquo;s only important in its relation to the others mentioned. Also note: the only relation that grades indoors have to grades outside is that a higher number <em>tends</em> to indicate greater difficulty, otherwise it&rsquo;s apples and oranges.
