<h1 id="on-climbing-and-failure">On Climbing and Failure</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been ruminating on failure recently afer realizing I&rsquo;m too cautious when
climbing indoors<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and it may be stunting progress in a pretty non-trivial
way.</p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always had a slight but pervasive fear of failure. That&rsquo;s healthy and
normal, right? What kicked off this particular iteration of self-reflection was
running into a friend at the bouldering gym with whom I lead-climb<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
regularly. He was excited to show me his bouldering project which was a v9.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
Our skill levels are similar so I was surprised by the grade. Indoors, I
typically flash<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> v6 and v7&rsquo;s tend to go<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> within a couple tries, but I&rsquo;ve
only ever done a couple v8&rsquo;s and I&rsquo;d never even tried a v9. He talked me into
trying his project. To my unmitigated surprise, I fell only at the last move. He
showed me another v9 that he was working on. Again, I did way better than I
expected.</p>

<p>The next time I went to the gym I sent the first v9 and made progress on the
second, getting within spitting distance.</p>

<h4 id="failure-avoidance">Failure Avoidance</h4>

<p>Why had I never tried a v9 before? Part of it is certainly that I assumed they
were too hard, but the more embarrassing part is that I was scared of failing.
Scared of walking up to something and looking like I had no business even
touching the start holds. In short: scared of looking stupid. Why is anyone
scared of failing? It&rsquo;s not necessarily the failing part, but failing in front
of your peers. Of being judged for that failure. Of losing face, or at least
perceiving it.</p>

<p>Playing it safe and only climbing things I was confident that I could do
has probably robbed me of progress for a long time.</p>

<h4 id="discovering-and-surpassing-limits">Discovering and Surpassing Limits</h4>

<p>Playing it safe to avoid failure is a recipe for complacency and stagnation.
Struggling promotes growth, success tends to just maintain.</p>

<p>This is immediately apparent for physical endeavours. You break down muscle so
that it comes back stronger. It&rsquo;s less obvious for mental endeavours, but imagine
a programmer who only ever implemented the fibonnaci sequence or a merge-sort
algorithm; small toys that they know they can write successfully. Or imagine a
chess player who only ever challenges their immediate family. The lack of
serious challenge will prevent any kind of progress.</p>

<p>Challenges without assured success are what reveal your true limits and allow
you to eventually (hopefully) surpass them. At best, you succeed and you have a
new personal best or newfound confidence in yourself; at worst, they provide a
barometer for growth or a future goal.</p>

<h4 id="addressing-the-fear">Addressing the fear</h4>

<p>Seek out challenges that seem too difficult and you may surprise youself.
Experiment with shifting the paradigm by making the entire goal to find the
point of failure. This is easier to do in some activites than others, but
finding something that seems out of reach and working on it anyways is at worst
a learning experience.</p>

<p>With respect to climbing, I intend to try at least one route/problem that is
significantly out of my range each session. I expect this will help me calibrate
my limits as well as help me get more comfortable with failing. For other
endeavors I&rsquo;ll try to be more conscious/wary of self-imposed limits.</p>
