<h1 id="nand-to-tetris">NAND to Tetris</h1>

<p>My first programming course was taught in Java. I often got distracted during
trying to imagine how Java worked under the hood. Type <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> and you get
<code>&lt;output&gt;</code>. Wait, how? What happens when I declare a variable? and why do I need
that <code>static</code> word up there? How does a text file get translated into something
the computer can use? And then after translation.. how does the computer
actually process that generated file?</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have enough spare time to get into hardware/EE or even lower level
programming while at school (I wasn&rsquo;t actually a CS major), so I wound up
accepting the magical computer on faith so I could move on with the assignments.
Since then, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about programming and the different types of
memory, some about compilation and bit about assembly (thanks primarily to <a href="http://microcorruption.com">the
microcorruption ctf</a>, which I <em>highly</em> recommend).
These experiences have helped satisfy some of the questions I had when first
learning Java years ago, but my understanding of underlying architecture, logic
gates, and CPUs could be a lot stronger.</p>

<p>Toward building an understanding of how computers work from first principles
I&rsquo;m working through a course called NAND to Tetris. Since transitioning
from not understanding a concept to understanding it often wipes your memory of
exactly how you were confused in the first place, I plan to write some posts as
I work through the course. In the posts, I&rsquo;ll include what I found to be most
interesting each week and what big questions were raised or remain because we
tend to forget these things in retrospect.</p>
